The resort now makes money on black instructors  instead of spending it on patrol service who chase them on slopes. Instructors gives all required docs on registration and also passes all quality validation tests of NLI remotely. Also instructor gives all needed docs to federal tax service and app pays the tax automaticly. So this app makes work of black instructors absolutely white and everyone happy.",
